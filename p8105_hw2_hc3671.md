## Problem 1

include packages that will be used:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

import and manipulate data.

``` r
pol_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |> 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),   # originally as character
    month = month.name[month],
    president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")
  ) |> 
  select(year, month, president, everything(), -c(day, prez_gop, prez_dem), )

snp_df = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(paste0("20", year)),
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = month.name[month],
  ) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day) |> 
  arrange(year, month)

unemploy_df = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(
      Jan:Dec,
      names_to = "month",
      values_to = "unemp_per"
  ) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = month.name[match(month, month.abb)]
  )

joint_df = 
  left_join(pol_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) |> 
  left_join(unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Description of the data sets above:  
The `pol_df dataset` contains information about the politicians of the
two parties in the USA, which includes the identity of the party and the
number of different politicians in both parties.The data span from 1947
to 2015, with monthly observations.  
The `snp_df dataset` shows the Standard & Poor’s stock market index
monthly from 2000 to 2099(including prediction).  
The `unemploy_df dataset` reports the monthly unemployment rate in the
United States. The data cover the period from 1948 to 2015. At first,
the value is presented in months. I reshaped them to make sure the
format is compatible with other datasets. The joint_df dataset is the
combination of the three dataset above, which obeys the date information
of the pol_df dataset. Some important values
includes:`yeas`,`month`,`president`,`close rate`,
and`umployment rate`.  

## Problem 2

``` r
Mr_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N653") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
    type = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
   ) |> 
  select(date, everything(), -c(dumpster, month, year))

Professor_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M120") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    type = "Professor Trash Wheel"
   ) |> 
  select(date, everything(), -c(dumpster, month, year))

Gwynnda_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L265") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    type = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel"
   ) |> 
  select(date, everything(), -c(dumpster, month, year))
  
trash_wheel = 
  bind_rows(Mr_trash_wheel, Professor_trash_wheel, Gwynnda_trash_wheel) |> 
  select(date, type, everything()) |> 
  arrange(date)
```

The final dataset has 1032 observations, including three trash
wheels:Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, Gwynnda Trash Wheel. Some
key values are dumpster identifier `type`, date `date` and the measure
of different kinds of trash like `weight_tons`, `volume_cubic_yards`,
`plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`, and `cigarette_butts`.  
More specifically, the total weight of trash collected by Professor
Trash Wheel is 246.74. And the total number of cigarette butts collected
by Gwynnda in June of 2022 is 0.

## Problem 3

``` r
zip = 
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip Codes.csv", na = "NA") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() 

price = 
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_month_NYC.csv", na = "NA") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    county_name = str_remove(county_name, " County$")
  ) |> 
  rename_with(~str_remove(.x, "^x"), .cols = "x2015_01_31" : "x2024_08_31") |> 
  rename(zip_code = region_name, county = county_name) |> 
  drop_na(`2015_01_31` : `2024_08_31`) |> 
  select(-c(region_type, state_name))

joint_data = 
  right_join(zip, price, by =c("zip_code", "county")) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    `2015_01_31` : `2024_08_31`,
    names_to = "date",
    values_to = "price"
  ) |> 
  select(
    state, city, county, state_fips, county_fips, county_code, metro,      neighborhood, zip_code, region_id, size_rank, date, price,             file_date
  )
```

The resulting tidy data is from the zip data left jointed by the price
data by both zip code and county name because there are same zip codes
in different counties. And I join the dates columns together and make a
new variable called dates. The final data consists 14 variables
including information of the location, dates, price and file dates.  
The final data contains 5568 observations and has 48 unique ZIP codes
with 20 unique neighborhoods.

There are 273 ZIP codes appear in the ZIP code dataset but not in the
Zillow Rental Price dataset like: 10451, 10452, 10453, 10454, 10455.
This may be because some zip place is not availabel for Zillow to
collect data and the collecting is not done yet.

``` r
top10_change = 
  joint_data |> 
  group_by(zip_code)  |> 
  summarise(
    price_max = max(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    price_min = min(price, na.rm = TRUE),
    price_range = price_max - price_min
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(price_range)) |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
  left_join(
    (
      zip |> 
        select(zip_code, neighborhood, county)
    ),
    by = "zip_code")

print(top10_change)
```
